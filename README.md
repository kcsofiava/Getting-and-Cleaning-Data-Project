##Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Hello!
This particular repository contains materials for my Coursera Johns Hopkins University Getting and Cleaning Data project. 

The dataset in question was collected by the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones;
For the full dataset, as well as a more detailed description, click [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The **run_analysis.R** script in this repository is my (slightly jumbled) code for the assignment that downloads the data sets, cleans them up a bit, and then targets mean and standard deviation data. 
The end result of this script is a tidy(er) data set, named tidy.txt

Check out **CodeBook.md** for more details on the whole assignment.
